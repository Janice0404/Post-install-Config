When discussing Os ticket configuaration, one would look at the mutiple roles and permissions granted with a agency to employees per that particular department, that would allow the employees access to certain admin roles, agents, etc. Within Os tickete each role has a set of specific permissions that can be checked/unchecked for employees given that role in association with their department they have access to. There are several roles that an employee can have such as Assign, create,close,delete, edit, completing task etc. Within the permissions tab of the employee Os ticket profile there is a section that the employee has, that allows functionality within the help desk which are not department specific access. Areas such as the User Directory, Organization, and Knowledge Base can be limited per employee for need to know bases. This includes the ability to search for and see the ticket metadata for tickets the Agent does not have access to, the email ban list, and other staff statistics on the dashboard.

There are mutiple departemnts that tickets are routed through departments in the help desk, there are also many settings that can be set for each department within a agency. These departements all have (SLA), that they must adhere to. (SLA) Service Level Agreement for tickets routed to department within a agency. SLA are the expected amount of time (in hours) that a ticket is expected to be closed once opened via Os ticket. If the ticket is not closed in the allotted amount of time, it will then be Overdue, at this point immediately follow up will be needed. SLA basically just ensures that all help desk tickets are being worked in a timley manner.
